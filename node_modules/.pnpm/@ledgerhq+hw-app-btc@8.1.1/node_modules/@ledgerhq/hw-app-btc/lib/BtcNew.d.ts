 * This class implements the same interface as BtcOld (formerly

 * which uses a totally new APDU protocol. This new
 * protocol is documented at
 * https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-bitcoin-new/blob/master/doc/bitcoin.md
 *
 * Since the interface must remain compatible with BtcOld, the methods
 * of this class are quite clunky, because it needs to adapt legacy
 * input data into the PSBT process. In the future, a new interface should
 * be developed that exposes PSBT to the outer world, which would render
 * a much cleaner implementation.

     * This is a new method that allow users to get an xpub at a standard path.
     * Standard paths are described at
     * https://github.com/LedgerHQ/app-bitcoin-new/blob/master/doc/bitcoin.md#description
     *
     * This boils down to paths (N=0 for Bitcoin, N=1 for Testnet):
     * M/44'/N'/x'/**
     * M/48'/N'/x'/y'/**
     * M/49'/N'/x'/**
     * M/84'/N'/x'/**
     * M/86'/N'/x'/**
     *
     * The method was added because of added security in the hardware app v2+. The
     * new hardware app will allow export of any xpub up to and including the
     * deepest hardened key of standard derivation paths, whereas the old app
     * would allow export of any key.
     *
     * This caused an issue for callers of this class, who only had
     * getWalletPublicKey() to call which means they have to constuct xpub
     * themselves:
     *
     * Suppose a user of this class wants to create an account xpub on a standard
     * path, M/44'/0'/Z'. The user must get the parent key fingerprint (see BIP32)
     * by requesting the parent key M/44'/0'. The new app won't allow that, because
     * it only allows exporting deepest level hardened path. So the options are to
     * allow requesting M/44'/0' from the app, or to add a new function
     * "getWalletXpub".
     *
     * We opted for adding a new function, which can greatly simplify client code.
