/**
 * Builds a fake Transport object to use in tests
 *
 * Note: no Transport methods are implemented, this is duck typing a Transport to use on unit tests where
 * the transport instance does not matter. If a specific value is expected from a method, you can pass the
 * fake method implementation to the `props` of the builder.
 *
 * If you want a working mocked Transport, you should use `MockTransport`.
 *
 * Ex:
 * ```
 * aTransportBuilder({
 *   exchange: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(Buffer.from("Test")),
 * }),
 * ```
 *
 * @param props Any value in props will override the default fake value of the same property/method
 * @return A duck-typed Transport
