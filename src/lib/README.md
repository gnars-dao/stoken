# 📂 Lib Folder

The "lib" folder contains various subfolders that organize the codebase for better maintainability and readability. This README provides an overview of what you can expect to find in each of these subfolders.

### 📁 Components/API
> This folder houses reusable components and APIs that are used throughout the application. These components are designed to encapsulate specific functionality or UI elements, making it easier to maintain and reuse code. You can expect to find:

- Component Files: TypeScript files (.ts or .tsx) containing React components.
- API Integration: Integration with external APIs or services, if applicable.

### 📁 Layout

> Header and Footer Components: These components are responsible for rendering the header and footer sections of the application, providing consistent navigation and branding.

### 📁 Pages

> The "Pages" folder contains the main views or pages of the application. Each page is a self-contained unit and represents a different view that users can navigate to. You will find:
> Page Components: TypeScript files (.ts or .tsx) representing individual pages/views.

### 📁 Router

**Routing Configuration:** Define the routes, their associated components, and any route guards.
**Navigation Helpers:** Utility functions for programmatic navigation.
